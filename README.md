Description
ImageAI is a Python library that simplifies the process of working with computer vision tasks such as object detection, image recognition, and instance segmentation. It provides an easy-to-use API that allows developers to integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into their applications without requiring in-depth knowledge of computer vision algorithms.

The library comes with a collection of pre-trained models that are ready to use out of the box. These models have been trained on large datasets and can accurately detect and recognize objects in images or videos. Additionally, ImageAI provides utilities for image manipulation, data preprocessing, and result visualization.

Installation
To install ImageAI, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. Then, you can use pip, the Python package manager, to install ImageAI and its dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install imageai --upgrade
For detailed installation instructions and alternative installation methods, refer to the official documentation.

Features
Object Detection: Detect and locate objects in images and videos.
Image Recognition: Classify images into predefined categories.
Video Object Detection: Analyze and track objects in videos.
Custom Training: Train custom object detection models using your own datasets.
Instance Segmentation: Segment and mask objects in images and videos.
Utility Functions: Various utilities for image manipulation and result visualization.
Usage Examples
python
Copy code
import imageai

# Create an instance of the ObjectDetection class
detector = imageai.Detection.ObjectDetection()

# Set the model type and load the pre-trained model
detector.setModelTypeAsYOLOv3()
detector.setModelPath("path_to_model_file")
detector.loadModel()

# Detect objects in an image
detections = detector.detectObjectsFromImage(
    input_image="input.jpg", output_image="output.jpg"
)

# Display the detected objects and their confidence levels
for detection in detections:
    print(detection["name"], " : ", detection["percentage_probability"])
For more detailed usage examples and API documentation, please refer to the official documentation.
