Usage
ImageAI provides a straightforward API for performing various computer vision tasks. Here's a basic example of how to use ImageAI for object detection:

python
Copy code
from imageai.Detection import ObjectDetection

# Load the pre-trained object detection model
detector = ObjectDetection()
detector.setModelTypeAsRetinaNet()
detector.setModelPath("path_to_model.h5")
detector.loadModel()

# Perform object detection on an image
detections = detector.detectObjectsFromImage(input_image="image.jpg", output_image_path="output.jpg")

# Print the detected objects and their percentages
for detection in detections:
    print(detection["name"], " : ", detection["percentage_probability"])
Refer to the official documentation for detailed usage instructions and examples for other tasks.

Features
Image Classification: Train and use custom image classification models.
Object Detection: Detect objects in images or videos with pre-trained models or your custom models.
Object Tracking: Track objects across consecutive frames in videos.
Image Segmentation: Segment images to identify regions of interest.
Custom Model Training: Train your own deep learning models using your own datasets.
